        <h4><strong>Web Development Reading List #168: Preload With Webpack, A Guide To Security Headers, And Service Worker Fallacies.</strong></h4>
        <br />
        <p><b>
    With great power comes great responsibility. This week I found some resources that got me thinking: Service Workers that download 16MB of data on the user’s first visit? A Bluetooth API in the browser? Private browser windows that aren’t so private at all?
    We have a lot of methods and strategies to fix these kinds of things. We can give the browser smarter hints, put security headers and HTTPS in place, serve web fonts locally, and build safer network protocols. The responsibility is in our hands.

    Joseph Medley tells us about API deprecations and removals in the upcoming Chrome 57.  will be removed, for example, as well as the prefix in some webkit-prefixed APIs.
    Chrome 56 is here with support for the Web Bluetooth API and the WebGL 2.0 API. The new version also finally supports position: sticky (the only browser still lacking support for it now is MS Edge).
    Safari 10.1 will be out soon with a lot of new features: fetch(), Custom Elements, CSS Grid Layout, Reduced Motion Media Query, and ES6 native modules are notable ones.
    Thanks to browser vendors pushing it aggressively, HTTPS adoption has now reached the tipping point. Good to see, especially since man-in-the-middle traffic modifications increased a lot on non-encrypted traffic in the last few months. Sadly, these interceptions are not executed by federal authorities or hackers but by companies like Comcast, Norwegian Airlines, hotel WiFi network companies and the like.
    Alexa top 1 Million sites redirecting to HTTPS
    A step into the right direction: Analyzing the Alexa top million websites, the percentage of sites that are redirecting users’ browsers from HTTP to HTTPs has doubled from August 2015 to August 2016. (Image credit)

    Addy Osmani wrote the Webpack plugin preload-webpack-plugin for wiring up  (and prefetch) automatically.
    Security Link
    Max Veytsman summarized everything you need to know about HTTP security headers. An all-embracing but concise guide to security headers and when and how to use them.
    Privacy Link
    DuckDuckGo published the results of a study they conducted on the question if private browsing really is private. Interestingly, most people have no idea about what the private mode in browsers exactly does and 84% of Americans would consider trying another major web browser if it offered more features to help protect their privacy. The full paper gives interesting insights into how people actually use search engines and how they try to protect their privacy.
